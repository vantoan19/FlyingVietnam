                Northern provinces destinations
            </h2>
            <p>
                Although Northern Vietnam gets fewer visitors than Ho Chi Minh City and the coastal cities in the south,
                 this is a region of the country not to be missed. Not only is the region home to Hanoi, Vietnam’s capital, 
                 it is also where you’ll find breathtaking bays, stunning rice terraces and unbeatable scenery. 
                 Northern Vietnam’s cultural attractions are just as diverse ranging from the chaotic highland markets 
                 to the hill-tribes in the far north. Narrowing down the many options to fit your itinerary can be tricky, 
                 but this list can help point you to the region’s top destinations.

                <img src="assets/destinations/hanoi.jpeg" alt="" class="destination-img">
                <p class="destination-desc">
                    If you only visit one place in Northern Vietnam, it will likely be Hanoi. 
                    As the nation’s capital, Hanoi is an exhilarating blend of eastern and western culture. 
                    French colonialism is visible through cuisine as well as architecture, particularly in the 
                    French Quarter in the Hoàn Kiếm District. Hanoi is packed with incredible temples, 
                    and a visit to the 11th century Temple of Literature is a must-do activity. 
                    The side-by-side Ho Chi Minh Museum and Mausoleum are also major attractions in Hanoi, 
                    and both are striking buildings from the exterior.

                <img src="assets/destinations/halong.jpeg" alt="" class="destination-img">
                <p class="destination-desc">
                    One of the best-known destinations in the entire country is Halong Bay. 
                    Its reputation is well deserved, because it is truly beautiful. 
                    Halong means descending dragons, which is indicative of the silhouette of the limestone 
                    outcrops that poke out from the water. Day cruises or overnight boat trips are a spectacular 
                    way to experience the beauty of Halong Bay and to see as many of the islands as possible. 
                    In addition to Cat Ba, Quan Lan is a popular stop that is beginning to develop some tourism 
                    infrastructure to accommodate a longer stay. You can go swimming, look for caves to 
                    explore or find some of the more remote, uninhabited islands while cruising through Halong Bay.

                <p class="destination-desc">
                    The mountainous town of Sapa is known for its culturally diverse population as well as its proximity to incredible scenery. 
                    Sapa itself is home to the members of many hill tribes, including the Hmong, the Dao, the Muong and the Tay. 
                    The town also overlooks the magnificent Muong Hoa Valley and its terraced rice fields, which are staggering to behold. 
                    If you want to get an inside look at the local residents and their cultures, then head to Sapa for an overnight trek or a homestay. 
                    You can hike out to the more remote villages and then spend the night, dining and learning from the hill tribe residents.

                Scroll troll down the narrow streets of Hoi An’s Ancient Town, where timber frame shophouses 
                still appear the way they did centuries ago, and the streets are aglow in colourful lanterns each night. 
                Or acquaint yourself with the final days of the Nguyen Dynasty in Hue, where royal citadels, 
                tombs and temples are sprinkled along the tranquil Perfume River.
                <br>
                In between, modern Danang City offers a taste of some of Vietnam’s most luxurious resorts and 
                top golf courses -- as well as one of the country's best beaches. And a few hours away, Phong Nha’s 
                spectacular caves are the latest frontier for nature enthusiasts.

                    The second Unesco site on our list, Hoi An is one of the most important tourist destinations in the country. 
                    An area once home to the Cham people, the small town grew in size and importance between the 15th and 19th centuries, 
                    attracting a large number of Chinese and Japanese traders and becoming known internationally as a 
                    top-tier Asian trading port. As a result, the well-preserved stucco buildings are awash 
                    in both Chinese and Japanese influences.

                    Danang is the nation’s third-largest city and a nice alternative to the cultural capital of 
                    Hanoi in the north and the economic centre of Ho Chi Minh in the south. Growing between the 
                    eastern peaks of the Annamite mountain range and the tranquil waters of the East Sea, this 
                    is one Vietnamese city that blends with its natural surroundings. For those interested in 
                    motorbike riding, the Hai Van Pass – perhaps Vietnam’s most famous road – lies a short distance 
                    to the north. The spectacularly fun zig-zag of tarmac traverses through lush jungle and 
                    massive stone boulders as it skirts the sea.

                    Adventurous foodies can sample bun cha ca, a soup made from sailfish and jellyfish, while most everyone 
                    can appreciate the region's fresh seafood, noodles, and pancakes, which have mass appeal.

                    Well-preserved temples, pagodas and tombs lie around every corner. There’s so much history here that 
                    it’s been named a Unesco site.

            </h2>
            <p>
                From island escapes to the non-stop action, southern Vietnam offers both vibrant 
                urban energy and mellow countryside. <br>
                Start off in the sensory overload that is Ho Chi Minh City, a metropolis where 
                humble mom-and-pop shops share street space with modern skyscrapers. Beyond the city 
                limits you’ll encounter the languid Mekong Delta, where life takes place on water and 
                farmland rolls out as far as the eye can see. <br>
                Not far away, Mui Ne lures holidaymakers with a laid-back beach vibe and reputation 
                as the kite-surfing capital of Vietnam. Offshore, islands such as Phu Quoc and Con Dao 
                will welcome you with pristine coastlines and untouched landscapes.

                    The dazzling, frantic city of Ho Chi Minh is the most populous and most visited city in Vietnam. 
                    A mix of history and heritage, and modern urbanisation it is easy to get lost in the fast pace and 
                    overwhelmed by the surroundings. It takes a special kind of nerve to cross the street for the first time, 
                    and yet the city draws you out, calling you to explore.
                    <br>
                    Ho Chi Minh City was formerly known as Saigon, and the more you explore the southern portions of 
                    Vietnam the more you’ll hear it still referred to that way. It was the capital of South Vietnam and 
                    the home of the government until the end of the Vietnam War.
