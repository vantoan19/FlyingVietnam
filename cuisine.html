                Travel around Vietnam, and you'll find that tastes and dishes vary from North to South. 
                In the capital, locals may lunch on bún chả with slices of pork belly, while the Saigonese 
                wolf down bánh xèo (crispy pancakes) rolled with greens and dipped in sweet-and-sour fish sauce. 
                In the former Imperial City, meaty bún bò Huế is a breakfast favourite, while in Hội An, 
                you can’t beat a bowl of toothsome cao lầu noodles for a quick snack. From simple home cooking 
                to addictive street eats to modern Vietnamese dining, it would take a lifetime to eat your way 
                through all this delicious diversity.

                <h3>Goi Cuon</h3>
                <img src="assets/cuisines/goicuon.jpeg" alt="goi cuon">
                <p class="destination-desc">
                    Goi Cuon are translucent spring rolls packed with greens, coriander and minced pork or shrimp.
                     A southern variation has barbecued strips of pork wrapped up with green banana and star fruit, 
                     and then dunked in a rich peanut sauce – every bit as tasty as it sounds.

                    Banh mi is one of the most popular street foods in Vietnam – and once you've read 
                    what goes into it, you'll be desperate to try it out for yourself! The Vietnamese
                     (or Saigon) sandwich was first created during French colonial rule during the 19th century. 
                     Banh mi uses a French baguette and is filled with a delicious selection of ingredients.

                <p class="destination-desc">
                    The country’s great staple dish is Pho (pronounced “fuh”). This noodle soup can be eaten at 
                    any time of day but is primarily eaten at breakfast. It originated in the north of the country 
                    but is now a national dish of Vietnam. A bowl of Pho consists of a light beef or chicken broth 
                    flavoured with ginger and coriander, to which are added broad, flat rice noodles and spring onions. 
                    Meat-wise, slivers of chicken, pork or beef are then added. Tofu is the main vegetarian option.
